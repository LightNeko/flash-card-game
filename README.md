# Flash Card Game
This is a JavaScript plugin for RPG Maker MV made as a class assignement for a learning videogame development course.

## Disclaimer
The code as it is works only with RPG Maker MV. 

Any assets (images, audio etc.) included with the original game were removed as I am not allowed to publish them here on github, therefore the plugin must be used with your custom assets. Although I am currently focusing on other projets, feel free to contact me if you are interested to see a demo of the plugin's functionalities.

I am not the author of the "probability.js" file accompanying the plugin, you can find more info about the original author and license in the file's commentary.
