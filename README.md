# Flash Card Game
This is a JavaScript plugin for RPG Maker MV made as a class assignement for a learning videogame development course.

ATTENTION: the code as it is works only with RPG Maker MV, also any assets (images, audio etc.) included with the original game can not be published as they are not free to use. Although I am currently focusing on other projets, feel free to contact me if you are interested to see a demo of the plugin's functionalities.
